## Juegos FPS y una crítica



+ CS:GO(Counter Strike Global Ofensive)
+ Saga DOOM:
  - DOOM 
    > All genres have a reference and in the FPS genre we have DOOM, a title that offers the essence that has made it a classic game. A very fun and highly recommended shooter that you can enjoy with three more players. 

    > Nintenderos
  - DOOM 2
    > Another amazing quality of this beyond awesome game, is that the guns basically aim for themselves, so you just point and shoot.

    >CPUGamer
  - DOOM 3
    > Doom 3 ignores all of the "rare" and "true find" tags and fills any void you might have had for having the piss scared out of you.

    >Next Level Gaming
  - DOOM ETERNAL
    > DOOM Eternal is a bloody masterpiece of glorious violence that may well be the best the series has ever been.

    > Cultured Vultures
